## Cron Job Setup Attempt

User requested a weekly AI news summary cron job:
- **Schedule:** Every Friday at 9:00 AM (Japan time)
- **Task:** Search and compile AI headline news covering model releases, company news, research breakthroughs, and industry trends
- **Delivery:** Pending user confirmation - either Slack DM (D0ACGA44Z6U) or webchat
- **Status:** Attempted setup but encountered schema validation errors with cron.add

### Issue Encountered
The cron job schema requires specific structure that wasn't clear from initial attempts:
- Error: "must have required property 'kind'" in payload
- Error: "unexpected property 'text'" in payload
- Multiple schema validation failures

### Next Steps
- Awaiting user confirmation on delivery method (Slack DM vs webchat)
- Timezone confirmed: Asia/Tokyo (GMT+9)
- Need to review cron schema properly or use alternative reminder mechanism
