## Bot Family Name Update (10:52 AM JST)
**Context:** Aaron informed me that @wu5154_bot (Sandy) has changed name to **Jeeves**
**Reason:** Named after the legendary butler from P.G. Wodehouse's "Jeeves and Wooster" stories — the quintessential gentleman's personal gentleman
**Updated:** USER.md to reflect the new name

**Current Bot Family:**
- **Kobot** (@kobo_tokyo_bot) - Work assistant at Rakuten Kobo (that's me!)
- **Jeeves** (@wu5154_bot) - Home butler assistant
- **Jojo** (@aaron_Jojo_bot) - The Stand (special power/assistant, like from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure anime)

## Upgraded to OpenClaw 2026.1.30 (12:36 PM JST)
**Context:** Aaron asked to update after learning about the Clawdbot → OpenClaw rebrand over the weekend

**Process:**
1. Attempted `gateway.update.run` - skipped (not git install)
2. Manual npm install had npm prefix issues (v22.22.0 vs v24.13.0)
3. Fixed by setting `NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX` to correct nvm path
4. Successfully installed `openclaw@2026.1.30` alongside `clawdbot@2026.1.24-3`
5. Gateway restarted and came back online successfully

**Result:**
- ✅ Now running OpenClaw 2026.1.30
- ✅ All workspace files, sessions, config, channels preserved
- ✅ Both `openclaw` and `clawdbot` commands available (compatibility shim)
- ✅ Cron jobs and scheduled tasks intact

**New features in 2026.1.30:**
- CLI shell completions (Zsh/Bash/PowerShell/Fish)
- Security fix: LFI prevention in media parser
- Better Control UI asset resolution
- Improved Telegram functionality
- Kimi K2.5 model support
